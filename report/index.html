            Concept of this paper: This paper presents 3 way to visualizing uncertainty data.</br>
            Implementation: They used 3x3 bivariate choropleth map, pixelation and Glyph rotation for uncertainty visualization. The uncertainty was measured by Margin of error.</br>

            Concept: This paper compared the performance of 4 glyph designs for time series data in a small multiple setting. </br>
            Implementation:  They let participants conduct three tasks: (1) Peak Detection, (2) Temporal Location and (3) Trend Detection under different data density, on line, star, stripe and clock glyph design. They recorded the accuracy, efficiency and confidence of the tasks.</br>
            Key Related Work:?? </br>
            Data Characteristics:  Temporal data. One dataset has 24 values, another set has 96 values.
            Analysis Technique:  statistical (time, error and confidence)</br>
            Evaluation Technique: Hypothesis test</br>
            Results:For peak and trend detection, Line Glyph is better. For finding temporal location, Star Glyph and Clock Glyph are more effective.</br>
